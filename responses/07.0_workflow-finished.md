## Nice work!

You've created your first GitHub Action and this course is now complete! 

<!-- Continue learning about actions by taking the next course in the [GitHub Actions Learning Path]() -->

In this repository:

- Your merge should trigger your action again, check it out in the [Actions tab]({{ repo }}/actions).
- The `Dockerfile` contains metadata for your action. Try changing some of that. You could, for example, change the icon that displays when the action is running.
- Change the `MY_NAME` environment variable to use your name instead of Mona's in `.github/workflows/main.yml`.
- Change the contents of `entrypoint.sh` to output a different message.

Outside of this repository:

- Review the [GitHub Actions documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-actions) on the GitHub Developer site.
- Use existing actions from the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions).
- Use existing actions from GitHub's [official actions community](https://github.com/actions).
- Use actions created by others in [awesome-actions](https://github.com/sdras/awesome-actions).

Next - an introduction to continuous integration (or CI for short!)
