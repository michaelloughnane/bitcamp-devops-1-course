Nice work, you committed a `Dockerfile`. You'll notice at the end of the Dockerfile, we refer to an entrypoint script.

```Dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]
```

The `entrypoint.sh` script will be run in Docker, and it will define what the action is really going to be doing.

## Step 2: Add an entrypoint script

An entrypoint script must exist in our repository so that Docker has something to execute.

### :keyboard: Activity: Add an entrypoint script and commit it to your branch

1. As a part of this branch and pull request, create a file in the `/action-a/` directory titled `entrypoint.sh`. 

In `entrypoint.sh`, all we're doing is outputting a "Hello world" message using an environment variable called `MY_NAME`.

2. Add the following content to the `entrypoint.sh` file:

   ```shell
   #!/bin/sh -l

   sh -c "echo Hello world my name is $INPUT_MY_NAME"
   ```

3. Stage and commit the changes
4. Push the changes to GitHub
