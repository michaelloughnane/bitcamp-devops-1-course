Nice work adding the `entrypoint.sh` script.

Next, we'll define a **workflow** that uses the GitHub Action.
Next, we'll define the `action.yml` file which contains the metadata for our action.

### action.yml

All actions require a metadata file that uses YAML syntax. The data in the metadata file defines the `inputs`, `outputs` and main `entrypoint` for your action.

## Step 3: Add an action metadata file

We will use an `input` parameter to read in the value of `MY_NAME`.

### :keyboard: Activity: Create action.yml

1. As a part of this branch and pull request, create a file titled `action-a/action.yml`.
2. Add the following content to the `action.yml` file:

   ```yaml
   name: "Hello Actions"
   description: "Greet someone"
   author: "octocat@github.com"

   inputs:
     MY_NAME:
       description: "Who to greet"
       required: true
       default: "World"

   runs:
     using: "docker"
     image: "Dockerfile"

   branding:
     icon: "mic"
     color: "purple"
   ```

3. Stage and commit the changes
4. Push the changes to GitHub
